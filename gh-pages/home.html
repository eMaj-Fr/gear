<h5 class="text-center">Meet Gear, an endless possibilities front-end Framework.</h5>
<hr>
<h2>What is Gear ?</h2>
<p>Another front-end framework. But here comes the twist : the production version of Gear contains Sass files. Gear has been designed with flexibility in mind : options, parameters, which means you can truly take control of your design.</p>
<h2>Who is it for ?</h2>
<p>Gear is for users already using a front-end Framework (Bootstrap, Foundation...), wanting to experiment something new and customize their design. And also more advanced users ready to make their hands dirty with loads of Sass functionnalities.</p>
<h2>Why ?</h2>
<p>No more little hacks or tweaks. Gear allows you to natively do what you want. Just grab the documentation, and tell Gear what to do according to your design.</p>
